Android mobile application to detect drowsiness and accident through AI and ML


## Short Overview

The project is basically a drowsiness and accident detection mobile app. The application is android based. The application is responsible for primarily detecting whether the driver is drowsing while driving or not; and whether an accident has happened or not. Both the detections are done through the smartphone only. No other apparatus is required for the application to work and perform. If drowsiness is detected, the app will initiate and show an alarm alert which will continuously play until the driver does not turn it off . If the driver is unresponsive for quite some time, then the app will send an emergency message to all the emergency contacts. The sent message will contain the current location of the driver, so that the driver can be tracked. In case of an accident, the same process will happen and all the concerned parties will be notified immediately.


Drowsiness detection is done through a face and eye detection algorithm. The algorithm uses machine learning to detect if the eyes of the driver are closed or not. Accident detection is done through the built-in accelerometer of the phone. The accelerometer senses if the device has experienced a strong fall due to a crash. If a fall is detected of a specific intensity, then it implies that an accident has happened. Another notable feature of the app is recording through the front camera of the mounted mobile phone. The recording will be getting captured simultaneously alongside with the detection process. The captured recordings will be used when compiling a report. The app also provides the feature of creating a report for insurance claims. The report will contain the recordings, location, messages and other relevant information of the time of the accident. All this data will be compiled into a single report for the ease of the user.
